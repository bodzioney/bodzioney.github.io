I am an incoming CS PhD student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) working with [Ningning Xie](https://xnning.github.io/). 

My research interests center around programming language theory, and in particular functional programming. I am currently studying type systems, logic, compilers, and a lot of random mathematical subjects.

Previously, I did my B.S. at University of Maryland, College Park where I worked with [Leonidas Lampropoulos](https://lemonidas.github.io/) on random program generation.
